# saucer_chess_component

Chess component module for Saucer Engine.

This can be a reference to build a new component module for [Saucer Engine](https://github.com/rilpires/saucer_engine). More instructions yet to come. For now, just copy-pasting this repo into a "{saucer_project_directory}/components/" folder will do the trick. Don't forget to turn on CMake cache variable "SAUCER_LINK_COMPONENTS".
